      <p>The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1980s.</p>
      <p> As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, high license compatibility.</p> 
      <p>The MIT License is compatible with many copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).</p>
      <p> Any software licensed under the terms of the MIT License can be integrated with software licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL</p>
      <p>Unlike copyleft software licenses, the MIT License also permits reuse within proprietary software
    <p> provided that all copies of the software or its substantial portions include a copy of the terms of the MIT License and also a copyright notice</p>
    <br>
      <p>MIT 허가서(영어: MIT License, MIT 라이선스)는 매사추세츠 공과대학교(MIT)를 기원으로 하는 소프트웨어 라이선스 중 가장 대표적인 것입니다.</p>
      <p>허가서를 따르는 소프트웨어를 개조한 제품을 반드시 오픈 소스로 배포해야 한다는 규정이 없습니다.
      <p> GNU 일반 공중 허가서의 엄격함을 피하려는 사용자들에게 인기가 있습니다.</p>
